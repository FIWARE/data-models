# Media Data Models

These data models describe the specific entity to record events generated by
multimedia sensors basing on computer vision. This pattern is based on using
computer vision or speech analysis techniques to transform a device camera into
an advanced sensor. Media servers provide, off-the-shelf, some basic computer
vision capabilities for detecting faces, detecting crowds, detecting car plates,
detecting movement, etc. Note that most of these analyses lead to generation of
data that takes the form of events (e.g. detected a specific face, detected a
car plate, detected an intruder, etc.) while also these events are used to
generate or update parameters from other entities such as cars, people, places,
etc.

You may want to manage these events as Context Information. This model
represents those events:

-   [MediaEvent](../MediaEvent/doc/spec.md). It represents a base for all events
    raised by elements in the media server.
