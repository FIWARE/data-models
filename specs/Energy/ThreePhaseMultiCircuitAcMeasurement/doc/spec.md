# Three-phase multi-circuit alternating current measurement

## Description

A ThreePhaseMultiCircuitAcMeasurement entity represents a measurement from
an electrical sub-metering system that monitors three-phase alternating
current across multiple circuits. Each circuit is assigned a voltage phase:
L1, L2 or L3; and has attributes for various electrical measurements such
as `current`, `power`, `energy`, `frequency`, and `harmonics`. There are 
cumulative metering values for each circuit (e.g. net energy) and the start
time for their measurement can be saved to the `dateEnergyMeteringStarted`
attribute. There are also attributes for different power and energy types
(`active`, `reactive` and `apparent`).

For most of the attributes there are various ways they can be actually
measured. For this purpose the `measurementType` metadata attribute can be
used. It can have the following values:

-   instant: The value is from the specific instant of time
-   average: The value is the average of a time period
-   rms: The value is the root mean square of a time period
-   maximum: The value is the maximum of a time period
-   minimum: The value is the minimum of a time period

When using the average, rms, mininum or maximum values another metadata
attribute called `measurementInterval` should be used to give the length of
the measurement period in seconds. Also the `timestamp` metadata attribute
should be the end time of the measurement period.

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).
