# FIWARE harvester - Spain weather stations

## Overview

It performs data harvesting using AEMET's data site as the origin and Orion
Context Broker as the destination.

## How to run

```console
docker run -d fiware/harvesters:weather-stations-spain \
           --timeout ${TIMEOUT} \
           --import \
           --orion ${ORION_ENDPOINT} \
           --path ${FIWARE_SERVICEPATH} \
           --service ${FIWARE_SERVICE}
```

## Optional parameters

It is possible to limit the amount of parallel requests to the sources and Orion
and not to import the predefined list of stations, but to download it on the
fly. See parameters in the [harvester](./spain_weather_stations.py).

## API key

If you do not import the predefined list of stations, please provide an API key
from AEMET. See the help at the header of
[harvester](./spain_weather_stations.py).
