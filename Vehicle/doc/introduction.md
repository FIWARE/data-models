# Vehicle Harmonized Data Models

These data models describe the main entities involved with smart applications that deal with vehicle entities.
When feasible, references to existing schema.org entity types and attributes are included.

These models have been devised to be as generic as possible, thus allowing to deal with different scenarios: 

+ Private Vehicles. 
+ Public Vehicles (Buses, Trains, etc.).  
+ Municipal Vehicles (pick up lorries, cleaning units, ...)
+ Special Vehicles (ambulances, fire brigades, ...)

The main entities identified are:

+ [Vehicle](../Vehicle/doc/spec.md) .It represents a vehicle with all its individual characteristics. 
+ [VehicleModel](../VehicleModel/doc/spec.md) .
It represents a model of vehicle, capturing its static properties such as dimensions, materials or features.
