# Environment Harmonized Data Models

These data models describe the main entities involved with smart applications that deal with environmental issues.

The main entities identified are:

+ [AirQualityObserved](../AirQualityObserved/doc/spec.md). It represents an observation of air quality conditions at a certain place and time. 
+ [AirQualityThreshold](../AirQualityThreshold/doc/spec.md). It allows to capture air quality thresholds which enable
to determine relative air quality levels (good, hazardous, etc.).
+ [WaterQualityObserved](../WaterQualityObserved/doc/spec.md). Allows to capture all the parameters involved in
Water Quality scenarios, allowing to deal with different scenarios:
    + Rivers and lakes.
    + Reservoirs like dams, cisterns, impoudments.
    + Sea locations.
    + Swimming pools or fountains. 
+ [NoiseLevelObserved](../NoiseLevelObserved/doc/spec.md). It represents an observation of those parameters
that estimate noise pressure levels at a certain place and time.
